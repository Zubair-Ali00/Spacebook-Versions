For this project i used the JavaScript Standard style

To maintain the style in my code i installed the JavaScript standard style module as a node command line program.
I would then often run the standard program in the root directory of my project which would read all my code and then identify any rules being broken, some of these broken rules could be fixed by running "Standard --fix".
The rules that could not be automatically fixed i could then easily identify in each file and manually fix the rules to adhere to the standard style.
